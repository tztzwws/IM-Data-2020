# How Data Analytics Can Be Misleading: Context, Method, and Validity
This workshop is to provide the participants with a zoom-out view on evaluating the quality of data analytics from the perspective of context, method, and validity. Instead of demonstrating the power of data analytics, this workshop shows the participants how data analytics can be erroneously conducted. With a series of small but intriguing examples, participants will have direct experience of how easily data analytics can deliver inconclusive and even misleading findings. Those examples include: 
•	Common stereotypes, such as students with excellent academic performance are not good at athletic sports, and leaders in the organizations are less intelligent than their subordinates. 
•	Controversial debates, such as if females are discriminated against in university admission, and if death penalty could curb crime.
•	Technical discussions, such as when adding more data to your model could be harmful, and when applying theoretical predictions resulted from one context to another context can be problematic.   

Those examples come with both R and Python codes for the participants to simulate the data generation process and “see” how and why subsequent data analytics can be wrong. 

In sum, the workshop aims to help participants to establish a system to evaluate data analytics procedures and outcomes critically, and in turn, make data analytics a force for good.
